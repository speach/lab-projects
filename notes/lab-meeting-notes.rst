Austin

- DHS downstream of CCND1 / APA

- TCGA CCND1-AS expression should be examined on both strands.

- CCND1-AS overexpression does not seem work in trans to affect (predicted
  to increased) CCND1 expression

- next CRISPR / Cas9 experiment **needs to have positive control,
  ideallyin positive control line**

- APA validation for HDAC11 / MXD4: neither validate statistically
  significant APA calls by PCR-based method

- Northern validation of PRELID1

- Also need to sequence end point PCR products to confirm sequences are
  correct.

- WTF HITS CLIP. Check adaptor sequences / protocols / data from other
  published CLIP studies
 
- :wq

Lab meeting 2014-03-21
----------------------

Suzi

- HPLC of dNTPs. Increasing ACN in buffer systems begins to split dUTP and
  dTTP. 

- dUTPase treatment partially destroys dUTP in standards

- Periodate is totally confusing. Follow up with Suzi.

- Borornate depletion of NTPs from mixtures.

Peptide sequencing project.

TCO / tetrazine immobilization

Super resolution approach.

Protein extension experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 + using glucose oxidase, Alexa 647 maleimide 
 + non-specific adsorption to flow cell surface
 + 6 M guanidine
 
 + questions: how do you know we're getting protein-dependent signal? 

 + Will move to STP to try C-terminal derivs

 + STORM demo
