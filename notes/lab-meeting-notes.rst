Austin

- DHS downstream of CCND1 / APA

- TCGA CCND1-AS expression should be examined on both strands.

- CCND1-AS overexpression does not seem work in trans to affect (predicted
  to increased) CCND1 expression

- next CRISPR / Cas9 experiment **needs to have positive control,
  ideallyin positive control line**

- APA validation for HDAC11 / MXD4: neither validate statistically
  significant APA calls by PCR-based method

- Northern validation of PRELID1

- Also need to sequence end point PCR products to confirm sequences are
  correct.

- WTF HITS CLIP. Check adaptor sequences / protocols / data from other
  published CLIP studies

----------------------

Suzi

- HPLC of dNTPs. Increasing ACN in buffer systems begins to split dUTP and
  dTTP. 

- dUTPase treatment partially destroys dUTP in standards

- Periodate is totally confusing. Follow up with Suzi.

- Borornate depletion of NTPs from mixtures.

Lab Meeting (with Johnson lab)

Alexis Z. Sirtuin Heterochromatin puts a block during DNA replication.

DNA replication, cell cycle picture

Euk DNA replication initiation. Origin licensing, origin unwinding by
(Cdc54-Mcm2-7-GINS) -> origin fires. Players suggest only interested in
lagging strand?

Chromatin structs challenge the fork. No fork on the slide. eu/hetero pic
not that useful.


SIR complex. Heterochrom formation and maintenance.

 1. recruitment
 2. deacetylation
 3. propagation


In vitro reconsitution of euk replication initiation. Recotnstitue  the
pre-RC, add DDK + S-phase extract are recruited

Look at heterochromatin formation +/- Sir2. Mcm10 recruitment is reduced
on heterochromatin templates.

Kerri. 5'-OH cloning in humans

-ligase, +RT controls depending on number of PCR cycles.

Human samples from Biochain.

Peptide sequencing project.

TCO / tetrazine immobilization

Super resolution approach.

Protein extension experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 + using glucose oxidase, Alexa 647 maleimide 
 + non-specific adsorption to flow cell surface
 + 6 M guanidine
 
 + questions: how do you know we're getting protein-dependent signal? 

 + Will move to STP to try C-terminal derivs

 + STORM demo

:Presenter: Monica

+ maybe treat dut ung yeast with UV to look at dimers in UU dimers.

+ CC to TT transitions are most common UV-associateed mutations.

+ Photolyase and NER. NER cuts up and downstream. 

+ want to understand correlation between UV damage and mutation.

+ Circularization approaches work for UV (no uracil yet). Added steps for
  isolation of DNA with photoproducts by antibody enrichment.

+ using UVB laser diode to irradiate.

+ 5'-OH RNA mapping

+ Can't map it until now

+ Ire1 / RNase L

+ known turnover pathway

+ Clp1 mouse

+ Monica does methylation / demethylation
