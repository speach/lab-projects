Lab meeting 2014-03-07
----------------------

Austin

- DHS downstream of CCND1 / APA

- TCGA CCND1-AS expression should be examined on both strands.

- CCND1-AS overexpression does not seem work in trans to affect (predicted
  to increased) CCND1 expression

- next CRISPR / Cas9 experiment **needs to have positive control,
  ideallyin positive control line**

- APA validation for HDAC11 / MXD4: neither validate statistically
  significant APA calls by PCR-based method

- Northern validation of PRELID1

- Also need to sequence end point PCR products to confirm sequences are
  correct.

- WTF HITS CLIP. Check adaptor sequences / protocols / data from other
  published CLIP studies
 
- :wq

Lab meeting 2014-03-21
----------------------

Suzi

- HPLC of dNTPs. Increasing ACN in buffer systems begins to split dUTP and
  dTTP. 

- dUTPase treatment partially destroys dUTP in standards

- Periodate is totally confusing. Follow up with Suzi.

- Borornate depletion of NTPs from mixtures.

Alexis Z. Sirtuin Heterochromatin puts a block during DNA replication.

DNA replication, cell cycle picture

Euk DNA replication initiation. Origin licensing, origin unwinding by
(Cdc54-Mcm2-7-GINS) -> origin fires. Players suggest only interested in
lagging strand?

Chromatin structs challenge the fork. No fork on the slide. eu/hetero pic
not that useful.


SIR complex. Heterochrom formation and maintenance.

 1. recruitment
 2. deacetylation
 3. propagation


In vitro reconsitution of euk replication initiation. Recotnstitue  the
pre-RC, add DDK + S-phase extract are recruited

Look at heterochromatin formation +/- Sir2. Mcm10 recruitment is reduced
on heterochromatin templates.

Kerri. 5'-OH cloning in humans

-ligase, +RT controls depending on number of PCR cycles.

Human samples from Biochain.
