Austin

- DHS downstream of CCND1 / APA

- TCGA CCND1-AS expression should be examined on both strands.

- CCND1-AS overexpression does not seem work in trans to affect (predicted
  to increased) CCND1 expression

- next CRISPR / Cas9 experiment **needs to have positive control,
  ideallyin positive control line**

- APA validation for HDAC11 / MXD4: neither validate statistically
  significant APA calls by PCR-based method

- Northern validation of PRELID1

- Also need to sequence end point PCR products to confirm sequences are
  correct.

- WTF HITS CLIP. Check adaptor sequences / protocols / data from other
  published CLIP studies
 
- :wq

Suzi

- HPLC of dNTPs. Increasing ACN in buffer systems begins to split dUTP and
  dTTP. 

- dUTPase treatment partially destroys dUTP in standards

- Periodate is totally confusing. Follow up with Suzi.

- Borornate depletion of NTPs from mixtures.
